# Hegemon Companion

A helper app for managing automas in the board game [Hegemony: Lead Your Class to Victory](https://hegemonicproject.com/games/strategy/hegemony/), by Hegemonic Project Games.

## Vision

Hegemon Companion enables gamers to enjoy the game to the fullest by reducing automa managing to a minimum. 
This is achieved by minimizing input needs and maximizing user guidance.

## Current functionality

The "Priority Editor" shows the current priorities for the automa. It allows the user to adjust them and to collapse the priority chart.

Currently only the priorities for the Capitalist Class Automa are provided.
